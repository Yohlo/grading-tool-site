# React.js Site used for Indiana University's CSCI-B351 Into to AI Autograder
-----

This React App was created in a rushed timeframe before the start of the Spring 2019 semester to be used for CSCI-B351 Intro to AI as an autograder.

The back-end for the autograder was created using Flask and can be found at this repo: [grading-tool-server](https://github.com/Yohlo/grading-tool-server)

This project is mostly undocumented. A complete rewrite (with documentation!) for the Fall 2019 semester is currently in progress. 

This App implements GitHub OAuth, uses Redux, Axios and the Blueprint.js framework.
